Artificial Neural Network

### What is mean by ANN?

An artificial neural network is an attempt to simulate the network of neurons that make up a human brain so that the computer will be able to learn things and make decisions in a humanlike manner. ANNs are created by programming regular computers to behave as though they are interconnected brain cells

## Problem Statement:

We have a dataset which contains the details of 50 startups. Build an ANN model to predict the profit of a new startup based on certain features.

## Objective:

To build ANN model to predict the profit

## Constraints:

To maximize the profit

### Key concepts about some libraries used in given code:

TensorFlow is an open-sourced end-to-end platform, a library for multiple machine learning tasks, while Keras is a high-level neural network library that runs on top of TensorFlow. 

Both provide high-level APIs used for easily building and training models, but Keras is more user-friendly because it's built-in Python

A Sequential model is appropriate for a plain stack of layers where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor

dense() is an inbuilt function of Tensorflow. js library. This function is used to create fully connected layers, in which every output depends on every input

The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is the most commonly used activation function in deep learning. The function returns 0 if the input is negative, but for any positive input, it returns that value back.

Dropout consists in randomly setting a fraction rate of input units to 0 at each update during training time, which helps prevent overfitting.
